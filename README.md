# Stock Price Prediction Using RNN
## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to try and predict the stock prices using historical data fromfour companies: IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). We use four different companies because they belong to the same sector: Technology. Using data from all four companies may improve the performance of the model. This way, we can capture the broader market sentiment.

## Business Value
Data related to stock markets lends itself well to modelling using RNNs due to its sequential nature. We can keep track of opening prices, closing prices, highest prices, and so on for a long period oftime as these values are generated every working day. The patterns observed in this data can then be used to predict the future direction in which stock prices are expected to move. Analysing this data can be interesting in itself, but it also has a financial incentive as accurate predictions can lead to massive profits

## Dataset Overview
ContextThe dataset consists of four CSV files corresponding to four stocks:AMZN,GOOGL,IBM, andMSFT. The files contain historical data that were gathered from the websites of the stock marketswhere these companies are listed: NYSE and NASDAQ. The columns in all four files are identical.
